### About Me

I'm never sure where to start this, because my career path has never been linear. I have a bachelor's degree in music from [Reed College](www.reed.edu), and then I was a bicycle mechanic. For a while I owned my own repair business; I moonlighted as a hammer salesman to pay the bills.

Now I work in tech.

I got there mostly by getting a [Master's Degree](http://ischool.uw.edu/) in Information Science -- effectively getting a degree in explaining what my degree means. Information Science is something I believe in very strongly, but it's still mostly unknown as a discipline. I like to put it this way:

> Information Science is the discipline of understanding what a person needs to know to Get Stuff Done, often in the context of an organization. Information Science is the study of how that information is generated, provisioned, delivered, communicated, used, stored -- the whole works. Information science is library science + design + an MBA.


I started in 2011 at [Self Aware Games](http://www.selfawaregames.com/); at the time, I was the first person to focus on user behavior. Information science has, it turns out, a complementary discpipline called data science, which I found and fell in love with. I learned to develop, first in the native PHP of our game servers, then in Python, then in functional Scala. I work extensively with HiveQL and some with IBM Netezza; I do a great deal of statistical analysis in R.

I code a lot in my free time now. After developing almost entirely proprietary internal tools, I finally got myself a [github account](http://www.github.com/Gastove) and started working on my own things on my own time. I wrote this site in Scala; I blog with Pelican.

When I'm not coding I read books, rock climb, play video games. I'm a cocktail and spirits afficionado; I like the opera, very much. I travel as I can, and ride my bicycle as much as I can.
